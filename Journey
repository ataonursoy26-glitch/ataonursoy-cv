## Profile
Ata Deniz Onursoy is a student with an early background in robotics, electronics, and foundational cybersecurity concepts. He has studied in Türkiye, the United States, and the United Kingdom, completing foundation-level programs in both academic and cyber-related subjects. His interests include mathematical reasoning, security principles, and the emerging field of post‑quantum cryptography.

## Education Background
He completed a foundation year in the United States and later continued his studies in the United Kingdom, where he also undertook a cyber foundation programme. His academic strengths include mathematics, logical thinking, and structured problem‑solving.

## Robotics Experience
He began working with robotics at a young age through FRC-style projects and school competition teams. His experience includes:
- designing and assembling competition robots within rule‑based frameworks  
- participating in tasks such as object scoring (e.g., shooting a ball into a target or placing objects through a ring)  
- contributing to mechanisms involving lifting, movement control, and structural design  
- working in coordinated team environments under specific competition constraints  

These early experiences helped him develop spatial reasoning, mechanical understanding, collaboration, and disciplined technical habits.

## Electronics Experience
He gained early exposure to electronics by spending time in a professional environment involved in defence‑related hardware and industrial electronic systems. Through this setting, he learned:
- through‑hole soldering and basic SMD rework  
- identifying common components on PCB boards  
- simple diagnostics and supervised troubleshooting  
- safe handling and assembly practices for electronics hardware  

This hands‑on work increased his confidence working with hardware and circuit-level tasks.

## Additional Technical Exposure
In the same professional environment, he frequently observed advanced industrial and defence-oriented robotic systems. These included automated application mechanisms, precision‑controlled assembly devices, and robots designed for hazardous or tightly controlled environments. Observing these systems at a young age strengthened his curiosity about how electronics, control circuits, and mechanical components integrate within real-world automated platforms. This exposure contributed to his long-term interest in technical problem-solving and the principles behind complex robotic systems.

## Cybersecurity Exposure
His interest in cybersecurity began with early curiosity about systems, games, and exploit behaviour. Over time he expanded this interest by:
- attending events such as BlackHat and BSides  
- observing professional demonstrations and introductory-level briefings  
- learning foundational ideas about vulnerabilities, threat models, and operational security  

These experiences improved his awareness of real-world security practices without implying advanced expertise.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Interest
He has a personal interest in the mathematical structures behind post‑quantum cryptography and the algorithms used in quantum‑resistant systems. This interest developed through:
- exposure to quantum computing concepts  
- following developments in PQC standards and their mathematical foundations  
- wanting to understand how security systems will adapt to future quantum capabilities  

This area remains a long-term academic interest.

## Software and Tool Exposure
Through coursework and foundational studies, he gained introductory exposure to:
- Wireshark for basic network traffic inspection  
- Magnet AXIOM for introductory digital forensics workflows  
- beginner-level programming fundamentals  

These tools provided initial familiarity with analytical methods used in networking, cybersecurity, and digital investigation contexts.

## Skills
- Basic robotics construction and mechanism work  
- Introductory electronics and soldering  
- Logical and mathematical problem‑solving  
- Curiosity-driven learning and exploration  
- Understanding rule-based technical environments  
- Exposure to cybersecurity and post‑quantum cryptography concepts  

## Personal Approach
He is motivated by learning, experimentation, and continuous improvement. Having lived and studied in Türkiye, the USA, and the UK, he has developed an adaptable mindset and a broad perspective on technical education. Early experience with hands‑on robotics, electronics, and analytical tools continues to shape his interest in developing deeper technical capabilities for the future.
